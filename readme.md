# Problem Set 2
"Due" date (as in, be ready to discuss what you have done so far): Tuesday, Sep 19.

# Comments/Description for the submited solution:
1. I prepared a PDF file named "Hw2_Chanci.pfd". This file describes all the results, includes the graphs and has some comments for each question.
2. I created the folder "Code". This folder contains two Matlab files (PS2_Ch.m and PS2_Ch_Extra.m) related to the homework. The file PS2_Ch.m is the main code for solving questions 2 to 4. The file PS2_Ch_Extra.m is the solution for question 5 (extra-credit).
